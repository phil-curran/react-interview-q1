## Issues

- I tried to delay the update of the name validation function so that it would not show a validation message until getting a response from the api, but wasn't able to get it working.
- I wasn't sure how to handle pre-existing data from the api that would populate the table, so I added a local state for the data that a user would add through the form. Ideally, the form validation would also check whether the name already exists in the table, but I ran out of time to implement that.
